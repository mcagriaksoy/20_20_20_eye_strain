# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-14

This project includes a desktop app and a Chromium browser extension. This policy uses plain language.

## Summary
- The desktop app runs on your computer and does not send personal data anywhere by default.
- The browser extension stores only simple settings (timer length, sound on/off) in your browser storage.
- No personal data is collected or shared by default.

## Permissions the extension may request
- Notifications — to show break reminders.
- Storage — to save your settings.

No access to your browsing history, files, or contacts is needed.

## Data sharing
- We do not share your data with third parties.
- If optional remote features are ever added, they will be clearly described and you will opt in first.

## Contact
If you have questions, open an issue in the repository or contact the project maintainer.
