# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-14

This Privacy Policy describes how the 20-20-20 app (desktop) and the Chromium extension handle information.

## Summary
- Desktop app: runs locally, does not collect or transmit personal data by default.
- Chromium extension: stores minimal settings locally and may request browser permissions required for notifications and optional features. No personal data is sent to external servers by default.

## Data Collected
- Local settings (timer durations, notification preferences) stored in local storage or local files.
- Optional: if you enable sound downloads or analytics (none enabled by default), only non-identifying usage metrics may be collected — this will be disclosed in the extension UI before enabling.

## Permissions (Extension)
The extension may request:
- Notifications — to show break reminders.
- Storage — to save your settings.
No access to browsing history, personal files, or other sensitive data is required.

## Sharing & Third Parties
We do not share personal data with third parties. If third-party services are introduced (e.g., optional analytics), they will be documented and opt-in.

## Security
Settings are stored locally. There is no remote transmission unless you explicitly enable an optional feature that requests it.

## Contact
If you have questions or requests regarding this policy, open an issue in the repository or contact the maintainer listed on the project page.
